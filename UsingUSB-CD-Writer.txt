Configuring and using the USB based CD-writer


1. Make sure that the USB root hub is enabled. 

If the device is not plugged in during system installation, the USB device may not be enable by default.
In either case, make sure the following line is in the /etc/fstab file:
none	/proc/bus/usb	usbdevfs	defaults	0 0


2. Find the right device for the CD-writer

If the CD-writer is plugged in during system installation, it will be mapped to /dev/cdrom and there will be a corresponding entry in the /etc/fstab file. However, this configuration will not work. The acctual device can be found with the KDE GUI with the "Hardware Browser". For support2, it is using /dev/scd0. Therefore, the entry in the /etc/fstab file has to be modified accordingly.


3. Building the ISO file

The files to be burned have to be built into a ISO file first. With root user, issue the following command:
mkisofs -r -o SomeName.iso /SomeDir

It is always nice to check the ISO file before burns it into a CD. Try to mount the ISO file first.
mount -t iso9660 -o loop SomeName.iso /mnt/cdrom


4. Burning the disk using cdrecord

"cdrecord" is a very popular command line tool set. Two options are most useful.

cdrecord -scanbus

This command will detect the available CD-writer. The result should look like:

# cdr -scanbus

With the above result, the real burning command can be like the following:

cdrecord -v speed=2 dev=0,0,0 -date SomeName.iso
