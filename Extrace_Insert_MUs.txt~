I have managed to extract the MUs and HDP from support3 and insert into support2.
1. delete the MU DA_US_U_02 from support3 and extract them with the following command


An uxlst mu and uxshw mu mu=* would be nice so we could see which mu have been extracted.
uxext ADM UG=* output=file1
uxext ADM TIH output=file2

No error message.
2. transfor the two files to support2 with FTP.

The first time I tried to insert the objects falled. It shows me the error
"Fatal error reading the requested object".
for the both commands. I guess this could be du to some promission or transmission  problems. 

This was due to the fact that the file was transfered in ascii mode and not in binary

3. Then I extracted the objects from support3 again, transfered the files to support2,
and insert the objects to support2,
uxins ADM UG=* input=file1
uxins ADM TIH input=file2


Same thing, it would be nice to have uxlst mu and uxshw mu mu=* before and after the manipulation to check it there were some modifications and which ones ....


It run successfully. No error message
