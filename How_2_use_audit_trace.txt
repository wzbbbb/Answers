Tracing the manual operations

It is possible to trace manual operations on a Dollar Universe Company, including creating/updating/deleting objects, creating/updating/deleting/disabling/enabling launches, etc. It is very userful for maintenance and support purposes. 


The monitored actions

Most of operations on a Dollar Universe Company through GUI or Dollar Universe commands are traced. The only actions that are not traced are the object distribution and transfer.


Trun on the audit trace mode

On Unix

Define the U_LOG_TRANS variable in the $UXMGR/uxsetenv files :

For uxsetenv and uxsetenv_ksh
U_LOG_TRANS=Y;export U_LOG_TRANS

For uxsetenv_csh:
setenv U_LOG_TRANS Y

Then reload the Dollar Universe environment
. $UXMGR/uxsetenv
Stop and restart the Dollar Universe Company
${UXMGR}/uxshutdown
${UXMGR}/uxstartup



On Windows 

Define the U_LOG_TRANS variable in 

the %UXMGR%\uxsetenv.bat files :
set U_LOG_TRANS=Y

the  %UXEXE%\UNIVERSE.def
U_LOG_TRANS Y

the %UXEXE%\[CompanyName].def
U_LOG_TRANS Y


Then reload the Dollar Universe environment
%UXMGR%\uxsetenv
Stop and restart the Dollar Universe Company
%UXMGR%\uxshutdown
%UXMGR%\uxstartup


After turning on the audit trace option, a uxiotrns.log will be created in the log directory of each area.



How to read the log file:

Let's consider the following record from the uxiotrns.log:


20040914 120532 : user_system [user1] user_universe [univa] profil [PROFADM] node [DA_US_W_04] prog [GraphicJobMonitor] DELETE CTL   key [S1        0000055TRAILER   0000152DA_US_U_05]

A record is consisted with several field. The above line records the following information:

On 2004-09-14 at 12:05:32, system user "user1" with Dollar Universe user "univa" with the profile "PROFADM", using the program "Graphic Job Monitor" deleted a record from the CTL. The session is S1 with session number: 0000055 and the uproc is TRAILER with uproc number: 0000152 in the MU DA_US_U_05.
