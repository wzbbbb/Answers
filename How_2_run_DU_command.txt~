How to use quotes on different operating systems?

Considering Unix, Windows and VMS, each of them has a list of special characters that could be used in a Dollar Universe command.
If the special meanings of those characters need to be reserved for the Dollar Universe command, they have to be quoted,  In another word, quoting those characters help to protect their special meanings from being interpreted by the operating system. Depending on the operating system, different kind of quotations will be needed. 

On Unix
+ - ( ) * \ { } [ ] and space are specific characters.
Two kinds of quoting can be used to protect these characters :
- The backslashed double quoting, if the only specific character is spaces : for example: \"text or code field\",
- The single plus double quoting : for example: '"text (or code field)"',

Examples
uxadd MU MU=CENTER LABEL=\"Company Center\" TNODE=$S_NOEUD
uxadd MU MU=CENTER LABEL=\"Company Center \(M\)\" TNODE=$S_NOEUD
uxadd MU MU=CENTER LABEL='"Company Center (M)"' TNODE=$S_NOEUD
uxupd UPR EXP UPR=D_LOAD_FIL TERMINS add TERMNO=01 TERM=D_LOAD_FIL PDATE='"(-1,,)"' STATUS=ABNORMAL
uxupd UPR EXP UPR=D_LOAD_FIL FORMULA LFORM='"=C01 AND =C02"'
uxupd UPR EXP UPR=D_LOAD_FIL FORMULA LFORM=\"=C01 AND =C02\"

Warning, some specific shells may need some specific quotings. The above has been tested against ksh and csh.

On Windows
+ - ( ) and space are specific characters.
One kind of quoting can be used to protect these characters :
- The backslashed double quoting. For example: \"text or code field\",

Examples
uxadd MU MU=CENTER LABEL=\"Company Center\" TNODE=%S_NOEUD%
uxadd MU MU=CENTER LABEL=\"Company Center (M)\" TNODE=%S_NOEUD%
uxupd UPR EXP UPR=D_LOAD_FIL TERMINS add TERMNO=02 TERM=D_LOAD_FIL PDATE=\"(-1,,)\" STATUS=ABNORMAL
uxupd UPR EXP UPR=D_LOAD_FIL FORMULA LFORM=\"=C01 AND =C02\"


On VMS
VMS has an additionnal particularity, when the command is translated by the operating system, the case of the argument is automaticaly modified.

Specific characters :
+ - ( ) and space are specific characters.
One kind of quoting can be used to protect these characters :
- The triple double quoting. For example: """text or (code field)""",

Examples
uxadd MU MU=CENTER LABEL="""Company Center (M)""" TNODE=TEST
uxupd UPR EXP UPR=D_LOAD_FIL TERMINS add TERMNO=02 TERM=D_LOAD_FIL PDATE="""(-1,,)""" STATUS=ABNORMAL
uxupd UPR EXP UPR=D_LOAD_FIL FORMULA LFORM="""=C01 AND =C02"""


Case sensitivity :
Every Dollar Universe objects are case insensitive (defined in uppercase by default) except the Dollar Universe node name.
The Dollar Universe node name is case sensitive, and the definition of a Dollar Universe node name must be strickly the same on the different nodes.

To protect the case sensitivity, the node name must be protected in the different command using the node and tnode argument.
The protection is done by a simple double quoting. For Example : "Node"

For example :
uxadd NODE TNODE="Node" LABEL="""Test machine"""  DIR="T"
uxshw node tnode="Node"

It is recommended to use the uxshw node command to confirm the proper creation of the node after using the uxadd command.
