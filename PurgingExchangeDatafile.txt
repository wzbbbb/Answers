  Call 4475  : New Executable image file uxresnod. This image make a purge within
               the exchanger files (u_fecl50 and u_fecd50) and the Event wait file
               (u_fmev50). This image may be used after a Universe node delete,
               from Graphical user interface or command interface. Each record from
               these three files, which contain one or more deleted node name,
               is deleted.
               This is an new function. (See -3-)

    (-3-) (4475) : The syntax is : $UXEXE/uxresnod <company_name> <area_code> <node_name>,
             with the following parameters rules:
             <company_name>  :  6 charaters
             <area_code>     :  1 charater (A, I, S or X)
             <node_name>     : ALWAYS the local universe node name.
       NOTE: Because the control of node name is made from Universe node table, which
            is ALWAYS read on local node, the use of universe local node as node name
            is MANDATORY. Use of distant node as node name may produce unpredictable
             results !!!

As requested by Susan, here is the procedure to identify the offending nodes
and to clean the exchanger data files.

From the $UXLEXE/universe.log, you will find a lot of similar messages:
<< 2010-07-21 03:09:01 0021710/uxech           /u_io_callsrv        /000000000
- u_connect error : Errno syserror 110: Connection timed out (host
  [wbaburl002])

These are from failed exchanger request, which will specify the remote hosts.  

From your universe.log, we find the following offending hosts.


wb9iracqasched
wbaburl002
wbaburl006
wbaburl009

To remove the data to be sent to these hosts from the exchanger data file: 
1. Remote the concerned node names from the node table of pmisors2;

2. Run the command:
$UXEXE/uxresnod <company_name> <area_code> <node_name>

For example:
$UXEXE/uxresnod WBPROD X pmisors2

Please note that you don't need to stop $U to run this procedure.
