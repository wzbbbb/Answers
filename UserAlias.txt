Basicly, for Windows NT/2000, you will need 2 lines in your useralias.txt file.
For example,  you have the following environment,
Windows Domain: Win_domain
Node name: NT1
Dollar Universe company: DU_Company
Windows User name: user1

your useralias.txt file should contains the following 2 lines


NT1              DU_companya            DU_Companya
Win_domain       user1      		DU_Companya

1. Make sure the company is not started 
2. Create a user that "password never expires"  and "user cannot change password" (with the "Advanced User Management") 
3. Load the $U Company environment
4. Check the %UXEXE%\[CompanyName]ServInstall.bat and find the line for UniServUser -install  
5. Run the command manually to install the user service
For example,

E:\QCL500\exec>UniServUser -install test support4 test
Univer$e test installed.

6. Edit the user service in the Windows Service Interface. You should see the "Display name": Univer$e [UserName]
a) Make it "Automatic" startup
b) Input the passwd for "Log On"

Case study: to run a uproc to access a NT domain exchanger server

1. create a user service with name "mail", with NT domain user access right, (NT domain username & password). For example, the NT Domain user is NTUser1, which defines the user service "mail"'s access right.
2. To use this user service to launch a job within Dollar Universe, there has to be a $U user with the same name as the user service; then it has to be the user "mail"
3. the $U user mail now can launch a job to access the exchange server. However, it can't launch a $U command, e.g. uxlst fla,  yet. So, next add an entry to the  useralias.txt file.
NTDomain   NTUser1	univa
4. now, the user mail will be able to run $U commands as univa, e.g. uxlst ctl, in a uproc. Also, the user NTUser1 will be able to run $U commands with the privilege of univa from command line.
