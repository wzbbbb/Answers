	To disable and enable DQM on Windows

Objective: The purpose of this document is to demonstrate how to disable and enable DQM on Windows. It applies only if DQM has been installed on your Windows host. 
DQM is independent of Dollar Universe Company. A Dollar Universe Company can work with or without DQM. If a DQM server is enabled, the Dollar Universe Company will submit its jobs to the DQM server instead of its internal job queue. 
 
1  To disable DQM

By default, if a DQM server is installed with a Dollar Universe Company, it will be started and used by the Dollar Universe Company. To disable DQM, you need to

a)  Shutdown the Dollar Universe Company, and modify the following 3 files:

b)  %UXMGR%\uxsetenv.bat 
Find the following line: 
	set    UNIVERSE_DQM_'CompanyName'=yes 
and change it to 
	set    UNIVERSE_DQM_'CompanyName'=no

c)  %UXEXEC\UNIVERSE.def and %UXEXEC\'CompanyName'.def
Find the following line: 
	UNIVERSE_DQM_'CompanyName' yes 
and change it to    
	UNIVERSE_DQM_'CompanyName' no 

d)  Start the Dollar Universe Company.

You will see that the DQM server will not be started any more.


2  To enable DQM 

The procedure is similar to above, just to modify those 3 files. Change the negative answers to positive, for example "no" to "yes". Then, restart the company.
After you have a DQM server enabled, don't forget to create at least one physical queue and start it.
PS: By default the jobs are submitted to the SYS_BATCH queue, so it is recommended to create this one as a physical queue first.


3 Creating Logical and Physical queues

3.1 Adding DQM to the Windows GUI (desktop). 

If the DQM queues is not shown in the Windows GUI. First, let's add the items to the Windows GUI:
a). Right click on the User Desktop --> Object folder --> DQM --> Dqm queue (see Figure 1)
b). Right click on the just created "Dqm Queue" item --> Selection folder --> Node --> select the nodes where the DQM servers will run (see Figure 2). If you want to do load balancing, you should have all of the involved nodes selected.
c). Right click on the just created "node" item --> Selection folder --> Area --> select the area to monitor (see Figure 3)
d). Left click on one of the just added areas, for example: Application area, you may see something like Figure 4. If your panel on the right side is empty, don't worry, that means you haven't create any queue yet. We will create some together in the next section.

3.2 Creating queues

3.2.1 Creating a physical queue
a). Select an area, for example, the production area, then right click on the right panel; (see Figure 5) then select "Create".
b). You should get a window like in the Figure 6. In this Window, you can specify the parameters for the queue. For now, all you need to do is to enter a name for the queue. You should have the following parameters for the queue.
	Name: 'some_queue_name'
	State: Stopped
	Node: Specifying the node where the queue is located
	Type: Physical
	Maximum number of ... : 999

Save the changes.
c). Now you should have the just created queue shown on the right panel. Right click on the queue name and select "Start" from the drop down menu.
OK, so far we have created and started a physical queue.

3.2.2 Creating a logical queue
Before we start, let's take a look at the defination of a logical queue.
Quoted from the "DQM Manual"
"A logical queue does not allow direct execution of a job.
It enables the jobs submitted to be dynamically distributed across its associated physical queues in order to optimize the machine occupancy rate." For more information, please check the "DQM Manual"

a). The same as creating a physical queue.
b). Specifying the "Type" as "Generic" and save, but do not close the window.
c). Selecting the "Attached queues" tab (see Figure 7)
d). From the drop down list, select the node names that you need to balance load with; and then, attach the physical queues from that node with the add button. 
e). Save and close the window.
