To be central monitored:
The following files on both of the monitoring nodes and the monitored nodes are needed to be modified. 
1. On the monitoring nodes, modify and restart
2. On the monitored nodes, modify and restart, the 2 stepps should be followed in the right order.

In uxlnmQCL500.dat file define:

/TABLE="LNM_QCL500"/NAME="S_CTRLCENT_X"/VALUE="IT"
R: Refused
W: Event wait
O: overdue 
A: waiting for execution (in a batch queue)
E: running
I: aborted
T: completed 
 
The above will work with all area.
If, for example, for the INT only, you can use
/TABLE="LNM_QCL500"/NAME="S_CTRLCENT_I"/VALUE="IT"

Then, the job in EXP area will not be central monitored.

Note: only one central Monitoring node can be defined in a node table.
Define the central monitoring node and the 
uxshw node tnode=*

On V500+FX24334C+FX24384B, if an ABORTED job is purged on a monitored node, the  
will not be purged on the central monitoring node.
