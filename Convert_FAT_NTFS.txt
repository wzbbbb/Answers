A: Standard Windows utility that is called CONVERT serves this purpose

Just go to the Command Prompt and execute the command: 

	C:\> CONVERT  C:  /fs:ntfs

Where C: is a name of the drive you want to convert. 

After machine re-boot conversion process will start and you'll have your FAT32 converted to NTFS without of data loss.
