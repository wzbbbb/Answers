When Dollar Universe submits a job, the launcher or the dqm server executes the following command :
su - "Submission account" ${UXEXE}/u_batch "Additionnal parameters"

The presence of the - in the su command asks unix to login to the submission account and load it's profile environment (.profile or .login depending on the shell of the user).

Some problems may happend if this file is not available or if the deamon which manages the su - process is overloaded.
But except that, there are no known problem regarding this submission process.

You may want to ask the some more information about the jobs which aborts and the symptoms etc ....
