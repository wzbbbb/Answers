When an external script is using the $1, $2, $3 ... variables, the uproc could not use the script directly.

The script have to be launched within the uproc...


#!/bin/ksh

/export/home/scripts/script.sh ${Var_1} ${Var_2}
l_rc=$?


(With Var_1 and Var_2 defined as variable on the uproc level)
