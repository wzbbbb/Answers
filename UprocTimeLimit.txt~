The following command has to be set in the uproc script :
uxsurjob NB_SEC $S_NUMPROC
NB_SEC: (in seconds) the maximum time a job can live 
$S_NUMPROC: Uproc ID number on UNIX

ex:
uxsurjob 3600 $S_NUMPROC 

if this command is inserted in the Uproc script,  the Uproc will be interrupted after one hour's execution.
We would advise you  first to test this command , to be sure that it corresponds to your needs.
