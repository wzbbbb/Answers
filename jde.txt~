
Submission of an UBE job by Dollar Universe is synchronous:

The submission of UBE job is performed with RUNUBEXML command.
The RUNUBEXML is used to form XML info and send it to JDE. It is the  

UBE job completion codes are:
  retrieved by the command uxstrjdexml for PeopleSoft EnterpriseOne which uses RUNUBEXML,
  returned to the Dollar Universe uproc execution that issued the submission of the UBE.


The command RUNUBEXML is launched within a uproc. It will communicate with the PeopleSoftone. 
It will: 
retrieve the report description, submit the report, check the status job, print the generated output, cancel the UBE job. Then the command of the Manager waits for RUNUBEXML to submit the UBE job.

On Unix, it is possible to stop a $U JDE job from $U, on Windows no.

...........License
Enter the expiry date and the license key. The date format is YYYYMMDD. The license key is a code of 18 characters. The license will be stored in the u_fali01.txt license file of the company in the mgr directory.

........... uproc templates

The uproc is stored in the file JDEXML_UX.ext for Unix or jdexml_nt.ext for Windows.
The template uproc is delivered in version 001 and can therefore be imported into any area.
The uproc template uses the uxstrjdexml command. The execution of this uproc generates the execution of a set of RUNUBEXML processes to trigger, monitor and, if necessary, abort UBE jobs.


...........Launch an UBE job
  Duplicate the uproc template.
  Update the variables of the new uproc: you must fill the name of the report to launch (REPNAME), the
report version (VNAME), the OneWorld user (JDE_OWUSER), the batch queue (JOBQUEUE). Update
also the optional variables if you want to print the generated report or execute a long running UBE job.
All of the variable are text type.
  Create a Dollar Universe launch to execute the new uproc. You can also modify the values of the
variables before launching the uproc. These values will override the uproc variables.

uxstrjdexml: Triggers a OneWorld job in synchronous or asynchronous mode
The commands can only be used from a uproc CL script.

...........env
The environment dedicated to the Manager for PeopleSoft EnterpriseOne has to be loaded prior to the
command execution:
  On Windows, the uxsetenv_jde.bat
  On UNIX, the uxsetenv_jde.ksh
file in the mgr directory has to be executed prior to command execution.

...........Trace mode
You can set the trace mode in the uxsetenv_jde script of the Dollar Universe mgr directory by setting to
"Y" the JDE_DEBUG variable.
uxstrjdexml generates traces in the standard output if the trace mode is enabled. When running in a uproc
context, the traces are written into the job log.


...........  Using porttest
The OneWorld command porttest is used to check whether the OneWorld user, password and environment
are correct. Use this command before submitting UBE jobs from within Dollar Universe.
In a terminal window, log as the Unix user account used to execute the uprocs designed to submit UBE jobs in
OneWorld, for example, log as univ50a. Make sure that the LD_LIBRARY_PATH or SHLIB_PATH
contain the path to the OneWorld libraries. Then execute the command:
porttest <OW_user> <passwd> <OW_env>
For example:
$SYSTEM/bin32/porttest ORSYP orsyp12 DV7333&
The command is launched in background to get the process id. If the user account is not allowed to run
porttest, you will get the message in the standard output:
Process <porttest> could not be registered.
porttest generates a log file in the log directory of OneWorld. The log file is jde_<processid>.log.
The runubexml generates the same message in the standard output when the OneWorld user, the password or
the OneWorld environment can뭪 be reached by the command. Check this problem with the administrator of
PeopleSoft EnterpriseOne.


...........For license issue: 

The following will show in the job log.

Exit code of uxstrjdexml is 8


...........uxstrjdexml exit code 9
If in the job log:
PROC_OPT_FILE_EACCES 9 The processing options file could not be found nor opened.

Check if the path defined by the JDE_XML_DIR variable in the uxsetenv_jde file does exist.

...........run time option:

Customize Runtime Options
The Operator can customize the execution of the UBE job by providing a runtime options file with the
optional parameter optfile=. The value of this option is the name of the runtime options file without suffix.
The Operator is supposed to prepare and store all the runtime options file in the directory pointed by the
environment variable JDE_CUSTOM_DIR. It is recommended to name the customization file as
<report_name>_<version> to make the association between the file and the UBE report. The runtime options
are stored in an XML file.

from uxsetenv_jde: 
export JDE_CUSTOM_DIR=/opt/orsyp/RUSSPD/exec/uxjde/custom

If they dont use any runtime option they should leave the uproc variable JDE_CUSTOM_FILE empty.
