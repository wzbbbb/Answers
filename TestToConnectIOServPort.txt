To tests the connection to a remote node please use the following procedure :
If the IO Server of the Dollar Universe Node "du_node_1" is unreachable ("du_node_1" is linked to "node_1" hostname) try the command (1):
telnet node_1 "Dollar Universe Company Name"_IO_X
If the command (1) gives you a connection to the IO Server, the issue comes from the Dollar Universe configuration (uxsrsrv.sck, uxsrsrv.alias, node declaration.)

If the command (1) does not give you any connection, the issues come from the network configuration.
In this case you can try the following command (2):
telnet "IP address of the node node_1" "Dollar Universe Company Name"_IO_X
If the command (2) gives you a connection to the IO Server, and the command (1) doesn't, the issue comes from the hostname -> IP address translation.

If the command (2) does not give you any connection, the issues come from the network configuration.
In this case you can try the following command (3):
telnet node_1 "IO_X port number of the Dollar Universe Company"
If the command (3) gives you a connection to the IO Server, and the command (1),(2) don't, the issue comes from the port name -> Port number translation.

If the command (3) does not give you any connection, the issues come from the network configuration.
In this case you can try the following command (4):
telnet "IP address of the node node_1" "IO_X port number of the Dollar Universe Company"
If the command (4) gives you a connection to the IO Server, and the command (1),(2),(3) don't, the issue comes from the  port name -> Port number translationand the port name -> Port number translation.
