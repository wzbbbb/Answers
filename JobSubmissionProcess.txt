When Dollar Universe submits a job, the launcher or the DQM server executes the following command :
su - "Submission account" ${UXEXE}/u_batch "Additionnal parameters"

The presence of the - in the su command asks unix to login to the submission account and load it's profile environment (.profile or .login depending on the shell of the user).

Some problems may happend if this file is not available or if the deamon which manages the su - process is overloaded.
But except that, there are no known problem regarding this submission process.

You may want to ask the some more information about the jobs which aborts and the symptoms etc ....

Job submission process:


===Within the Dollar Universe Company:

Once the a job is created from a Dollar Universe Company, a record is written into the u_fmsb50.dat file. The launcher will check the file.

If DQM is not used, it will create a sub uxord process to handle the job.
Otherwise the launcher will connect to the DQM TCP port, and transfer the job to DQM. DQM will spawn a sub process to handle the job.

Then a record will be writen into the u_fmcx50.dat file. The job will be in PENDING status for now.


===Into the OS with u_batch

The DQM will su to the proper user (both of the DQM and uxord processes are owned by root) and launch the job to the OS with the $UXEXE/u_batch. The u_batch is considered as an envelope.


The following is abstracted from result of pstree -acl

  |-uxdqmsrv) GCO210 X DA_US_U_05
  |   `-uxdqmsrv) GCO210 X DA_US_U_05
  |       `-sh) -c ...
  |           `-su) - univa -c ...
  |               `-ksh) -c ...
  |                   `-u_batch) /apps/du/GCO210/exec/u_batch univa 001 GCO210
M2 SYS_BATCH ...
  |                       `-sh) /apps/du/GCO210/exp/upr/SLEEP300.000
  |                           `-sleep) 300


u_batch will run in the following order:

uxjobinit -> U_ANTE_UPROC -> uproc script -> U_POST_UPROC -> uxjobend

uxjobinit

1. Will copy the uproc script to $U_TMP_PATH; 
2. Inform the IO server that the uproc script has been launched into the
system. The IO will change the status of a job from PENDING into EXECUTING. 
3. If the $U_TMP_PATH is not accessible, it will have "File open error" from uxjobinit.
4. If the IO server is not available at this time, uxjobinit will complain in the universe.log. 


Then, the all of the required environment variable will be prepared. 

U_ANTE_UPROC

Uproc Script : set the return code

U_ANTE_UPROC


uxjobend

inform the IO server the RESEXE (return code of the uproc script).
The IO will then change the status of the job.

The RESEXE is set with the return code of the uproc script and can be captured withing the U_POST_URPOC.

If a job is completed after the Dollar Universe Company shutdown and before its restart, it will be in ABORTED status.
If a job is completed after the Dollar Universe Company restarted, the proper status will show.
