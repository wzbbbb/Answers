$UXDQM/uxshwque QUEUE=Q  NODE=N1

This command returns the state of logical or physical queue, their definition and the jobs list that is in the queue (executing or pending).

This command starts a physical or a logical queue. 
This command must be done after creating a queue (created in the "stopped" state).

$UXDQM/uxstrque queue=Q node=N1


$UXDQM/uxstpque QUEUE=Q NODE=N1

This command stopps a physical or a logical queue. 
e.g.
$UXDQM/uxstpque queue=Q node=N1
