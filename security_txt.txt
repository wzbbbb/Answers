Reproduced on REFERA (SPRE0021D)
Using user univa with the profile PROFADM
Editted the security.txt file for the PROFADM profile to
   AREA=X*
   -
   DISPLAY

The Motif interface still shows exp area.
The command line:
# ./uxlst ctl exp
 Command : uxlst ctl exp status=* inf

api_cmd_SetEnv Initialization error
Access denied - insufficient rights
command in error!!

And got the following error message in the universe.log file.
